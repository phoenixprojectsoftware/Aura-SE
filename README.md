## About Aura
Aura is a modification of Adrenaline Gamer created by Martin Webbrant and fireblizzard. It is
used by **The Phoenix Project Software** for the game [*Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours.*](https://moddb.com/mods/zamnhlmp)
Before ZAMNHLMP used Aura, Phoenix used a different codebase named *'creaTive Deathmatch Player,'*
which originally started development in April 2019. ZAMNHLMP started using **Aura** with version 2.4.

TPPS currently has plans to use Aura for other multiplayer Half-Life 1 based games.
