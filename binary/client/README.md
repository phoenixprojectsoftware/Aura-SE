    Enter `https://github.com/phoenixsoftware/Aura-CL.git` and press the Clone button. Wait for the process to finish.
1. You can build the project using CMake→Build All. To find the built client.dll, go to CMake→Cache (x86-Debug Only)→Open Cache Folder→OpenAG.

### Manually using Git and CMake
1. Install Visual Studio 2017 or above, Git and CMake. Make sure to add them to PATH.
1. Clone the repository.
1. Open Git Bash in the OpenAG folder.
1. `git submodule update --init`
1. `cmake -A Win32 -B build`
1. `cmake --build build --config Release`

## macOS
1. Install Xcode.
2. Install CMake via Homebrew.
3. `git submodule update --init`
4. `mkdir build`
5. `cd build`
6. `cmake ..`
7. `cmake --build . --config Release`

## Linux
### GNOME Builder
1. Set up Flathub by following the [guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for your distribution.
1. Install [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder).
1. Open GNOME Builder.
1. Press the Clone Repository button, enter `https://github.com/phoenixsoftware/Aura-CL.git` and press Clone Project. Wait until it finishes.

   The cloning window should close, and a new window with the OpenAG project should open.
1. If Builder prompts you to install missing SDKs, press Install and wait for the process to finish. It will take a while. You can monitor the progress by pressing the circle in the top-right.
1. Click on the bar at the top-center which says OpenAG, and click the Build button.
1. Once the build finishes, in the same bar menu click the Export Bundle button. The file manager will open in a path that looks like `gnome-builder/projects/OpenAG/flatpak/staging/x86_64-master`. Navigate up to the `OpenAG` folder, then down to `builds/pro.openag.OpenAG.json-...` where you will find the built `client.so`.
1. Now you can make some changes to the code and press Build, then grab `client.so` from the same folder.

### Manually via Terminal / WSL 2
Side-note: if you're using WSL, it's recommended you use Ubuntu 18.04 from the Microsoft Store.
1. Get a 32-bit/multilib **gcc** (6 and above) or **clang** (3.9 and above) build environment set up, as well as CMake.
2. `git submodule update --init`
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cd build`
